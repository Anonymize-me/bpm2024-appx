### Models & metrics
The **process models metrics** used in this work are listed in the file 'Appx - List of metrics.pdf'
A high definition picture of each **process model** used in the experiment is available in the directory 'models-img'.
The **tasks** used in the experiment are detailed in the file 'Appx - Tasks.xlsx'
The measure of each metric is computed in the file 'Appx - Measures (metrics applied to models).xlsx'


### Analysis
The Python notebooks are available in the directory 'analysis'
The plots of visual behaviors for all participants are available in the directory 'AOIs_over_time-img'
